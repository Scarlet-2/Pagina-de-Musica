        The time has come to an end <br>
        Yeah, this is what nature planned <br>
        Being tracked by a starving beast <br>
        Looking for it's daily feast <br>
        A predator on the verge of death <br>
        Close to its last breath <br>
        Getting close to its last breath <br>
        Rules of nature <br>
        And they run when the sun comes up <br>
        With their lives on the line (alive) <br>
        For all that I've (no choice) <br>
        Gotta follow the laws of the wild (alive) <br>
        With their lives on the line (no choice) <br>
        Out here only the strong survive <br>
        What's done is done <br>
        Survived to see another day <br>
        The game of life <br>
        The hunter and the agile prey <br>
        No guarantee <br>
        Which of them will succeed? <br>
        Strong or weak? <br>
        Rules of nature <br>
        Rules of nature <br>
