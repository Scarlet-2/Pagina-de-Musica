        Birds in the sky <br>
        Carry these words for me <br>
        Life tasted sweet: <br>
        It let me live; let me breathe <br>
        Love, hurt so bad <br>
        But still, Saved my soul <br>
        Flowers of a brighter past: <br>
        They bloomed so free beneath the sun <br>
        Memories, I want to give them to you <br>
        So you can see what we left there <br>
        When all hope bleeds out <br>
        What remains is doubt <br>
        Should've left it all for you, For tomorrow <br>
        As your time draws near <br>
        Will you live in fear? <br>
        Could've left it all for you <br>
        But we let go <br>
    </p>
