        Red sun <br>
        Red sun over paradise <br>
        Red sun <br>
        Red sun over paradise <br>

        Golden rays of the glorious sunshine <br>
        Sending down such a blood-red light <br>
        Now the animals slowly retreat <br>
        To the shadows – out of sight <br>
        Arid winds blow across the mountains <br>
        Giving flight to the birds of prey <br>
        In the distance machines come <br>
        To transform eden – day by day <br>

        Only love is with us now <br>
        Something warm and pure <br>
        Find the peace within ourselves <br>
        No need for a cure <br>

        When the wind is slow <br>
        And the fire’s hot <br>
        The vulture waits to see what rots <br>

        Oh, how pretty <br>
        All the scenery <br>

        This is nature’s sacrifice <br>

        When the air blows through <br>
        With a brisk attack <br>
        The reptile tail ripped from its back <br>

        When the sun sets <br>
        We will not forget the <br>
        Red sun over paradise <br>

        Red sun <br>
    </p>
